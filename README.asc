== Example topographic datasets for use with LSDTopoTools


This repository contains some example topographic datasets that are used in the examples within the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book[LSDTopoTools book]. 

The examples are in a few different formats so you can get some experience using http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html[GDAL utilities].

=== A warning
The entire repository has ~100Mb of files. 
If you only want to test out the small datasets you should download individual files. Do this using `wget`.
For example:

[source,console]
